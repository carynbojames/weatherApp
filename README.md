# weatherApp

## Description
The project uses server side APIs to pull data from the [OpenWeather One Call API](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api) to create a tool that allows users to search for weather in a city. 

## Functionality
- The user enters the city they want to search 
- They are given the weather for today including a five-day forecast
- The searched city is added to a list of previously searched cities
- The user can search a new city or re-pull the data from a previously searched city

Future Improvements: Allow the user to clear the search history
